# NLP-Part-of-Speech-Tagging
This program creates a ML model which tags part of speech for each word. It can also predict part of speechs in a random sentence.The data file used to teach our model is the "Klington" file and after we train the model, test on a random sentence to see if the classification of words is correct. Python libraries and KERAS have been used for this algorithm.
